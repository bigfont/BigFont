                    Shaun was born and raised in Vancouver and completed post secondary education at the

                    2008, he sampled careers in health care, leisure administration, and academic research.
                    The latter included co-publishing a paper on Motor Learning with Dr. Nicola Hodges.</p>
                <p>

                    Tony's career in marketing and advertising began in
                    television. He segued from that into the advertising
                    agency business where he planned strategy for a
                    large variety of clients that included packaged goods
                    marketers, international banks, real estate, and retail.
                    
                    <p>Among the many notable clients Tony worked with in
                    Canada were such as J.M. Schneider out of Kitchener
                    Ontario and the introduction of Ikea into North
                    America at the beginning of 1977.</p>
                    
                    <p>At a later time Tony began to specialise in hands-on consumer research
                    as the foundation for my planning <abbr title="Modus operandi">MO</abbr> when he
                    adopted the anthropological method of ethnography
                    as his primary method in qualitative studies.</p>
                <p>                
                    Tony's international experience spans several
                    countries in Africa in addition to Britain, where his
                    career commenced, and of course North America.
                    He is familiar with working among diverse cultures
                    and language groups. He documented arguably the
                    most influential experience of his youth in the wilds of
