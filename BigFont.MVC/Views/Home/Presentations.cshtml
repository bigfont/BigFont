            Big Font presents a <strong>twelve-session</strong>, continuing computer education class for PC. It is designed for businesses in particular but is suited to computer-literate people who want to be up-to-date. Attendees will enhance their knowledge of existing programs but more importantly use that knowledge to keep up with where the Industry is going i.e. transitioning to The Cloud.

            We tend to become comfortable with what we know and inclined to resist change. Yet who would want to go back to the computers of 1984? With that in mind, we need to keep up with an industry that continues to grow and is becoming more sophisticated while at the same time making it easier to operate – if only we knew how.
        </p>
        <p>
            What this series of classes sets out to do initially is review your present level of knowledge of such as Windows 7 (that now really is passé) or Windows 8 and the same generations of compatible programs in Office Suite like Word, Excel, Outlook and others.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll progress from there to show you where it's all going, as with soon-to-be-launched, Windows 10; but also, One Drive, Office 365 and The Cloud. There’s catching up to do to remain compatible with businesses already embracing the improved technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like it or not, it’s only a matter of time before buying the latest program (or even a computer) will be obsolete. All you’ll need is a terminal, (a subscription,) and an up-to-date browser. This course will help get you there.
