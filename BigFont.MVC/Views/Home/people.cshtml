    <p>
        Tony's career in marketing and advertising began in
        television. He segued from that into the advertising
        agency business where he planned strategy for a
        large variety of clients that included packaged goods
        marketers, international banks, real estate, and retail.
    </p>
    <p>
        Among the many notable clients Tony worked with in
        Canada were such as J.M. Schneider out of Kitchener
        Ontario and the introduction of Ikea into North
        America at the beginning of 1977.
    </p>
    <p>
        At a later time Tony began to specialise in hands-on consumer research
        as the foundation for his planning
        <abbr title="Modus operandi">MO</abbr>
        when he
        adopted the anthropological method of ethnography
        as his primary method in qualitative studies.
