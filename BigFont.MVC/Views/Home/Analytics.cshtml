    <p>This section is under construction. Todo:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make the Analytics page load in HTTPS because the Google API auth requires that. <span class="label label-success">Done.</span></li>
        <li>Upgrade the website to Bootstrap 3 because it's more modern.</li>
        <li>Do the data binding for analytics with AngularJS because it's more powerful than jQuery and it's more modern.</li>
        <li>Display date range for analytics statistics because the data is somewhat meaningless without that. <span class="label label-success">Done.</span></li>
        <li>Display total visits because that is an interesting marketing statistic. <span class="label label-success">Done.</span></li>
        <li>Display visits by viewport size because this will inform UI design decisions.</li>
        <li>Display visits by browser because this will inform UI design decisions. <span class="label label-success">Done.</span></li>
        <li>Allow an <i>optional</i> drill down into visits by browser version because this will inform UI design decisions.</li>
        <li>Add a login page because client analytics should not be public.<span class="label label-success">Done.</span></li>
        <li>Add a login form to the login page because login requires this.<span class="label label-success">Done.</span></li>
        <li>Enable interested BigFont website clients to login because then they can view their Analytics.</li>
        <li>Enable BigFont.ca Google Analytics admin to login because this is a test case for the BigFont clients. <span class="label label-success">Done.</span></li>
        <li>Authorize the BigFont analytics programmatically so that anonymous web site users can view them.</li>
        <li>Only show the logout button to authenticated clients, because logout only makes sense to clients who have logged in already.</li>
        <li>Only show the register button to administrators, because we do not want to have open registration.</li>       
        <li>Update the navbar collapse width OR decrease the width of the navbar contents, because currently, on medium width viewports, the navbar is going to two rows before it collapses, and this looks ugly.</li> 
        <li>Move this todo somewhere else because it is not appropriate as a publically facing page.</li>
    </ul>
