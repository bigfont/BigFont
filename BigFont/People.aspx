                    I was born and raised in Vancouver and completed post secondary education at the
                    University of British Columbia. After receiving a Bachelor of Human Kinetics in
                    2008, I sampled careers in health care, leisure administration, and academic research.
                    The latter included co-publishing a paper on Motor Learning with Dr. Nicola Hodges.</p>
                <p>
                    In 2010 I enrolled in an intensive software development program at the BC Institute
                    of Technology. Since graduation I have provided Web development and technical support
                    services to small and medium-sized businesses. I am a Microsoft Certified Professional
                    Developer.</p>
                <p>
                    In 2011 my wife Kathryn and I moved from Vancouver to Salt Spring Island. Recently
                    I decided to start BigFont.ca with two goals. The first is to assist businesses
                    in need of sophisticated
                    <abbr class="initialism" title="Information Technology">
                        IT</abbr>
                    solutions. The second is to help residents in need of home technical support.</p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time I study chess, practice sleight-of-hand, and am a prolific reader.

                    My passion is designing intuitive and attractive web sites that are built on uncompromising
                    user-centred information design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I studied Internet technologies at Capilano College, and Java programming and database
                    design at Simon Fraser University in 1999. Later, I established my own business.
                    I am also skilled at web graphics and web page layout and design, content editing
                    and print formatting. I firmly believe that communication is key in everything we
                    do, and I bring that to website development in every way I can.</p>
